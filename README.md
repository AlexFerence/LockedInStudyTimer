# LockedInStudyTimer
CHECK IT OUT!!!: http://lockedin.site/

A timer that provides a student with the scientifically proven most efficient way to study with the 25/5 study/break ratio and after 4 intervals the student is rewarded with a 20 minute break. I personally use this while I study becasue I like to get the most out of my time in the library. After the study interval, the bar will fill and the student will be notified with a sound.
